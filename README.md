# Squid5 with SSL proxying

From https://github.com/wrouesnel/docker-squid4

This dockerfile builds a Squid 5 instance and includes all the necessary
tooling to run it as a MITM (man-in-the-middle) SSL proxy.

There's a number of reasons to do this - the big one being optimizing caching
and delivery of objects during docker builds which might be downloading them
from SSL protected endpoints.

It will require you to generate your own CA and set it as trusted.

The resulting docker image uses the following configuration environment
variables:

 * `HTTP_PORT`
    Default: `3128`
 * `ICP_PORT`
    If set, enables ICP on the given port for all users.
 * `HTCP_PORT`
    If set, enables HTCP on the given port for all users.
 * `MITM_PROXY`
    If set, tries to enable MITM SSL proxy functionality (requires CERT and KEY)
 * `MITM_CERT`
    If set, the given PEM certificate is copied and used as the CA authority for 
    MITM'ing connections.
 *  `MITM_KEY`
    If set, the given PEM certificate is copied and used as the signing key for 
    the MITM CA.
 * `VISIBLE_HOSTNAME`
    Default: `docker-squid4`
    Should be set to a unique value if you are chaining multiple proxy servers.
 * `MAX_CACHE_SIZE`
    Default: `40000`
    Cache size in megabytes. The cache defaults to `/var/cache/squid4`. You 
    should mount a volume here to make it persistent.
 * `MAX_OBJECT_SIZE`
    Default `"1536 MB"`
    Maximum object size to store in the cache. This is set high as one of my
    typical use cases is proxying distribution images.
 * `MEM_CACHE_SIZE`
    Default: `"128 MB"`
    Default memory cache size. I've no real clue what this should be, but RAM
    is plentiful so I like to keep it fairly large.
 * `CACHE_PEERx`
   Cache peers for the squid instance may be specified with multiple CACHE_PEER
   environment variables. The suffix of each is used to determine ordering by
   the unix `sort` function.
 * `EXTRA_CONFIGx`
   Extra non-specific configuration lines to be appended after the main body of
   the configuration file. This is a good place for custom ACL parameters.
 * `CONFIG_DISABLE`
   Default `no`
   If set to `yes` then squid configuration templating is disabled entirely, allowing
   bind mounting the configuration file in manually instead. The certificate and SSL
   setup still runs normally.
 * `DISABLE_CACHE`
   Default ``
   If set to `yes` then squid configuration templating removes all `cache_dir`
   lines, setting squid to memory only cache.
 * `TLS_OPTIONS`
   Default `NO_SSLv3,NO_TLSv1`
   Allow overriding the default tls_outgoing_options supplied to OpenSSL. These
   are safe defaults, but if you're in a really broken environment might not be
   usable.

# Example Usage
The following command line will get you up and running quickly. It presumes
you've generated a suitable CA certificate and are intending to use the proxy
as a local MITM on your machine:
```
sudo mkdir -p /srv/squid/cache
docker run -it -p 3128:127.0.0.1:3128 --rm \
    -v /srv/squid/cache:/var/cache/squid4 \
    -v /etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro \ 
    -v /etc/ssl/private/local_mitm.pem:/local-mitm.pem:ro \
    -v /etc/ssl/certs/local_mitm.pem:/local-mitm.crt:ro \
    -e MITM_CERT=/local-mitm.crt \
    -e MITM_KEY=/local-mitm.pem \
    -e MITM_PROXY=yes \
    squid
```

Note that it doesn't really matter where we mount the certificate - the image
launch script makes a copy as root to avoid messing with permissions anyway.

## Unit File for systemd
This is an example of a systemd unit file to persistly start squid4:
```
[Unit]

Requires=docker.service

[Service]
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill squid4

    -v /etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/local_mitm.pem:/local_mitm.pem:ro \
    -v /etc/ssl/certs/local_mitm.pem:/local_mitm.crt:ro \
    -e MITM_KEY=/local_mitm.pem \
    -e MITM_CERT=/local_mitm.crt \
    -e MITM_PROXY=yes \
    --name squid4 \
    squid
